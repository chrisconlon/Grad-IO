\section{Overview}

{
\frametitle{Overview}
In this lecture we explore recent approaches to estimating models through the use of inequality restrictions, rather than equality restrictions.  \\
\vspace{0.2in}
The motivation for these approaches comes from:

\begin{itemize}
\item Economic problems that cannot be empirically investigated with
more standard techniques (e.g., discrete games)

\item Sampling methodology or measurement limitations in data (e.g. we don't know an agent's exact income, but we know whether it lies in an
interval, so we can get inequalities on income; or
we have topcoded income)
\end{itemize}
}
higher than the returns they would have earned had they made an
alternative feasible choice.
\vspace{0.1in}

\item Assume a parametric ``return function.'' 
\vspace{0.1in}

\item For each value of $\theta $, compute the difference between the observable part of the actual realized returns and the observable part of returns the agents would have earned had they made the alternative choice.
\end{itemize}
}

\frame[plain]
{
\frametitle{Economic Model}
\begin{itemize}

\item Estimator:\ Accept any value of $\theta $ that, on average, makes the
observed decisions better (more profitable)\ than the alternative.
\vspace{0.1in}

\item Question:\ When do such (possibly set valued) estimators enable us to
make valid inferences on the parameters of interest?
\end{itemize}

}

\frame[plain]
{
\frametitle{Economic Model}

There is more than one set of conditions that can be used to justify
inequality estimators.  We will consider the following two such sets of conditions:\\
\begin{itemize}
\vspace{0.1in}
\item The set that uses only ``structural errors'' (i.e., assumptions
that are the multiple-agent analog of the assumptions used in discrete
choice econometrics). \\
\vspace{0.1in}

\item The set that incorporates expectational and measurement errors along with the structural errors.\\


\end{itemize}
}

\frame[plain]
{
\frametitle{Economic Model}
\begin{itemize}
\item  Ciliberto and Tamer \textit{(Econometrica 2009)} develop the estimator based on the first set of conditions in the context of an entry model.\\
\vspace{0.1in}
\item Pakes, Porter, Ho and Ishii \textit{(Econometrica 2015)} develop the estimator based on the second set of conditions.\\
\vspace{0.1in}
\item  Pakes\ \textit{(Econometrica 2010)} provides a comparison of the two sets of conditions.\\
\end{itemize}
}




\section{Conditions Common to the Two Inequality Estimators}


\frame[plain]
{
\frametitle{Conditions Common to the Two Inequality Estimators}
Recall the first two conditions that are relevant to discrete games.  We covered these in the last lecture.\\

\begin{enumerate}
\item \textbf{Nash Condition\ (C1)}
\begin{equation*}
\sup_{d\in D_{i},d\neq d_{i}}\mathit{\varepsilon }\left[ \pi (d,\mathbf{d}_{-i},%
\mathbf{y}_{i},\theta _{0})|\mathit{I}_{i}\right] \leq \mathit{\varepsilon }%
\left[ \pi (d_{i},\mathbf{d}_{-i},\mathbf{y}_{i},\theta _{0})|\mathit{I}_{i}%
\right] 
\end{equation*}
where $D_{i}\subset D$, for $i=1,...,n$.\\
\vspace{0.1in}
\item \textbf{Counterfactual Condition\ (C2)}

\begin{equation*}
\mathbf{d}_{-i}=d^{-i}(\mathbf{d}_{i},\mathbf{z}_{i}),\text{ \ }\mathbf{y}%
_{i}=y(\mathbf{z}_{i},\mathbf{d}_{i},\mathbf{d}_{-i}),\text{ }and
\end{equation*}
the distribution of $\mathbf{z}_{i}$ conditional on $\mathit{I}_{i}$ does
not depend on $d_{i}$.

\end{enumerate}
}
\frame[plain]
{\textbf{Implications of conditions C1 and C2:}\\
\vspace{0.2in}
If $d^{\prime }\in D_{i}$ and 
\begin{equation*}
\Delta \pi (d_{i},d^{\prime },d_{-i},z_{i})=\pi (d_{i},d_{-i},z_{i})-\pi
(d^{\prime },d_{-i},z_{i})
\end{equation*}
then%
\begin{equation*}
\mathit{\varepsilon }\left[ \Delta \pi (d_{i},d^{\prime },\mathbf{d}_{-i},%
\mathbf{z}_{i})|\mathit{I}_{i}\right] \geq 0.
\end{equation*}

To use this inequality directly as a basis for an estimation algorithm, we need the
relationships between:

\begin{itemize}
\item The expectations underlying agents' decisions ($\mathit{\varepsilon }(.)$%
) and the expectations of the observed sample moments ($E(.)$),

\item $\pi (.,\theta )$ and $(z\,_{i},d_{i},d_{-i})$ and their observable
analogues.
\end{itemize}

This is where the two approaches differ.  We covered the first set in the last lecture.

\begin{enumerate}
\setcounter{enumi}{2}
  \item \textbf{ Expectational Condition (FC3)}
\begin{equation*}
\pi (d,d_{-i},z_{i},\theta _{0})=\mathit{\varepsilon }\left[ \pi (d,\mathbf{d}%

\end{equation*}%
\begin{equation*}

\textbf{Implications of conditions FC3 and FC4:}\\
\begin{equation*}
\Delta \pi (d_{i},d^{\prime },d_{-i},z_{i}^{o},\upsilon _{2,i}^{f};\theta

\end{equation*}
\begin{equation*}
(\upsilon _{2,i}^{f},\upsilon _{2,-i}^{f})|_{z_{i}^{o},z_{-i}^{o}}\sim
F(.;\theta _{0}).
\end{equation*}
(Note that there may not be a $\theta $ that satisfies these
conditions for all vectors of decisions.) To ensure that the model assigns
positive probability to the observed decisions for some $\theta $ we
typically also assume:%
\begin{equation*}
\pi (d_{i},d_{-i},z_{i}^{o},\upsilon _{2,i}^{f})=\pi
^{as}(d,d_{-i},z_{i}^{o},\theta _{0})+\upsilon _{2,i,d}^{f},
\end{equation*}
and that the distribution $\upsilon _{2,i}^{f}$ conditional on $\upsilon
_{2,-i}^{f}$ has full support.

\section{Estimation from Inequality Conditions (Structural Errors Only)}

\frame[plain]
{
\frametitle{Estimation from Inequality Conditions (Structural Errors Only)}
This section follows Ciliberto and Tamer (2009), which studies entry in the airline industry.\\
\vspace{0.1in}
Start with the  formulation of profit in Berry (1992):

\begin{equation*}
\Pi_{m,k,N} =X_{m} \beta - \delta \text{log} N + Z_k \alpha +  (\rho u_{m0} + \sqrt{1- \rho^2} u_{mk})
\end{equation*}

\begin{itemize}
\item $(X_{m} \beta - \delta \text{log} N) $ is the observable component of profit that is common to all firms in a market
\item $Z_k \alpha$ is the observable component of profit that varies across firms within a market. 
\item The unobserved components of profit also have a common component $(\rho u_{m0}) $ and a firm-specific component ($\sqrt{1- \rho^2} u_{mk}$).
\end{itemize}

}

\frame[plain]
{
\frametitle{Estimation from Inequality Conditions (Structural Errors Only)}
Ciliberto and Tamer allow for a more flexible profit function, seen here:

\begin{equation*}
\Pi_{m,i} =S_m'\alpha + Z_{im}' \beta_i + W_{im}'\gamma_i + \sum_{j \neq i} \delta_{j}^{i}y_{jm} + \sum_{j \neq i} Z_{jm}'\phi_j^i y_{jm} + \epsilon_{im}
\end{equation*}

\noindent
\footnotesize
Definitions: \\
$S_m$ denotes market characteristics common to all firms\\
$Z_{im}$ is a vector of firm characteristics that enter into the profits of all firms in the market (e.g., product attributes that consumers value)\\
$W_{im}$ is a vector of firm characteristics that only affect firm $i$'s profit in market $m$\\
$y_{jm}$ is an indicator for the presence of other firms $j\neq i$ in market $m$\\
$\delta_{j}^{i}$ captures the effect of having firm $j$ in market $m$ on firm $i$'s profit\\
$\phi_j^i$ captures firm-interaction effects that arise through the $Z_m$'s.\\
$\epsilon_{im}$ has several components: destination, origin, airport, and a firm-market unobservable.  This maps to the $\upsilon_{2,i}$ error in our notes, and is assumed to be observed by all players.\\
%$K$ is the number of potential entrants in market $m$\\

}

\frame[plain]
{
\frametitle{Estimation from Inequality Conditions (Structural Errors Only)}
We can write down the conditions from the theoretical model (C1 and C2) given this profit function, as well as the conditions that allow us to translate the theoretical model to the data in a perfect information, ``structural errors'' world (FC3 and FC4).  \\
\vspace{0.2in} 
Note that although the model
does specify a parametric distribution for the $(\upsilon
_{2,i}^{f},\upsilon _{2,-i}^{f})$ conditional on the observables, it does
not deliver a likelihood.  \\
\vspace{0.2in} There is no function that takes values of the $%
z^{o},\upsilon _{2}$ and $\theta $ vectors into uniquely-specified actions,
so we cannot construct probabilities for those actions.  \\
\vspace{0.2in} 
This result comes directly from the inequalities of the entry game, and is due to the possibility of multiple equilibria.  
}

\frame[plain]
{
\frametitle{Results/Conditions that the Inequalities \\with FC3 and FC4 Deliver}

\begin{enumerate}
\item We can check whether the conditions of the model are satisfied at the
observed $(d_{i},d_{-i})$ for any $(\upsilon _{2,i}^{f},\upsilon
_{2,-i}^{f}) $ and $\theta $, and this, together with $F(.,\theta )$,
enables us to calculate the probability of those conditions being satisfied
at any $\theta $. \\
\vspace{0.2 in} 
These are necessary conditions for the choice to be made:\
therefore when $\theta =\theta _{0}$ the probability of satisfying them must
be weakly greater than the probability of observing $(d_{i},d_{-i})$. \\
\vspace{0.2 in} 
I.e. the model delivers an \textit{outer measure}\ for the actions conditional on $%
\theta $.
\end{enumerate}
}

\frame[plain]
{
\frametitle{Results/Conditions that the Inequalities \\with FC3 and FC4 Deliver}
\begin{enumerate}
\setcounter{enumi}{1}
\item We can check whether $(d_{i},d_{-i})$ are the only values of the
decision variables to satisfy the necessary conditions for any $(\upsilon
_{2,i}^{f},\upsilon _{2,-i}^{f})$ and $\theta $, and this can be used to
provide a lower bound on the probability of actually observing $%
(d_{i},d_{-i})$ given $\theta $. \\
\vspace{0.2in}
When $\theta =\theta _{0}$ the probability
that we observe these decisions is weakly greater than the probability that
they're the only values that are consistent with the model. \\
\vspace{0.2 in} 
I.e., the model also delivers an \textit{inner measure} for the action conditional on $\theta $.
\end{enumerate}

}

\frame[plain]
{
\frametitle{Results/Conditions that the Inequalities \\with FC3 and FC4 Deliver}
More formally, define the probability that the model generated by C1, C2,
FC3 and FC4 with the additive separability constraint, a model we will call
MF, is satisfied at a particular $(d_{i},d_{-i})$ for a given $\theta $ to
be: 
\begin{equation*}
\bar{P}\left\{ (d_{i},d_{-i})|\theta \right\} =\Pr \left\{ (\upsilon
_{2,i}^{f},\upsilon _{2,-i}^{f}):(d_{i},d_{-i})\text{ satisfy MF}%
|z_{i}^{o},z_{-i}^{o},\theta \right\} ,
\end{equation*}%
and the analogous lower bound to be:%
\begin{equation*}
\text{\b{P}}\left\{ (d_{i},d_{-i})|\theta \right\} =\Pr \left\{ (\upsilon
_{2,i}^{f},\upsilon _{2,-i}^{f}):\text{only }(d_{i},d_{-i})\text{ satisfy MF}%
|z_{i}^{o},z_{-i}^{o},\theta \right\} .
\end{equation*}
}

\frame[plain]
{
\frametitle{Results/Conditions that the Inequalities \\with FC3 and FC4 Deliver}
Were we to know the equilibrium selection mechanism we could also calculate
the actual likelihood of $(d_{i},d_{-i})$ for a given $\theta $ or%
\begin{equation*}
P\left\{ (d_{i},d_{-i})|\theta \right\} =\Pr \left\{
(d_{i},d_{-i})|z_{i}^{o},z_{-i}^{o},\theta \right\} .
\end{equation*}

We \textit{do not know} the selection mechanism but we do know that for the true
selection mechanism when $\theta =\theta _{0}$%
\begin{equation*}
\boxed{\bar{P}\left\{ (d_{i},d_{-i})|\theta \right\} \geq P\left\{
(d_{i},d_{-i})|\theta \right\} \geq \text{\b{P}}\left\{
(d_{i},d_{-i})|\theta \right\} .}
\end{equation*}
}

\frame[plain]
{
\frametitle{Results/Conditions that the Inequalities \\with FC3 and FC4 Deliver}
Let $\left\{ {}\right\}$ be the indicator function which takes the value
one if the condition inside the brackets is satisfied and zero elsewhere.\\
\vspace{0.2in}
Let $h(.)$ be a function which takes only positive values.\\
\vspace{0.2in}
Let $E(.)$ provide expectations conditional on the process actually generating the data
(including the equilibrium selection process).
}

\frame[plain]
{
\frametitle{Results/Conditions that the Inequalities \\with FC3 and FC4 Deliver}
 Then\ MF implies that%
\begin{equation*}
E_{\upsilon _{2}}(N^{-1}\sum_{i}(\bar{P}\left\{ (d_{i},d_{-i})|\theta
\right\} -\left\{ d=d_{i},d^{-i}=d_{-i}\right\} )h(z_{i}^{o},z_{-i}^{o}))
\end{equation*}%
\begin{equation*}
=\boxed{N^{-1}\sum_{i}(\bar{P}\left\{ (d_{i},d_{-i})|\theta \right\} -P\left\{
(d_{i},d_{-i})|\theta \right\} )h(z_{i}^{o},z_{-i}^{o})\geq 0\text{ }at\text{
}\theta =\theta _{0}\text{.}}
\end{equation*}

which gives us a moment inequality. An analogous moment inequality can be
constructed from the condition on \b{P}$\left\{ (d_{i},d_{-i})|\theta
\right\}$:

\begin{equation*}
=\boxed{N^{-1}\sum_{i}(P\left\{(d_{i},d_{-i})|\theta \right\} - \b{P}\left\{ (d_{i},d_{-i})|\theta \right\})
h(z_{i}^{o},z_{-i}^{o})\geq 0\text{ }at\text{
}\theta =\theta _{0}\text{.}}

\frametitle{Estimation Routine - Ciliberto and Tamer (2009)}
The estimation routine:
\begin{itemize}
\item constructs unbiased estimates of $(\b{P}(\cdot|\theta),\bar{P}(\cdot|\theta))$, 
\item substitutes them for the true values of the probability bounds into these moments, and
\item accepts values of  $\theta$ for which the moment inequalities are satisfied.
\end{itemize}
\vspace{0.1in}
Since typically neither the upper nor the lower bound are
analytic functions of $\theta$, we employ simulation techniques to obtain an unbiased estimate of them.\\

\frametitle{Data - Ciliberto and Tamer (2009)}
The same data used in Berry (1992):
\begin{itemize}
\item DB1B data from 2001 (no price data).  
\item A market is a trip between two airports and a direction, regardless of stops. 
\item The data covers a sample of markets between the top 100 MSA's; 2742 markets.   \item Ciliberto and Tamer focus on strategic interactions between American, Delta, United, and Southwest and pay particular attention to Dallas because of the Wright Amendment.  
\item They construct Berry's ``airport presence'' variable; they do not have cost data, but they have plane capacities and they use that to construct an opportunity fixed cost of serving a market.
\end{itemize}
}

\frame[plain]
{
\frametitle{Results - Ciliberto and Tamer (2009)}
Tables 3 and 4 in Ciliberto and Tamer report confidence intervals for points (i.e. the probability that the confidence set covers the identified set is .95). Table 3 assumes iid errors.  \\

\vspace{0.1in}
\begin{itemize}
\item The first column constrains competitive effects of each firm's presence in the market on other firms to be the
same.  So, as in Berry (1992) there is a unique number of
firms. The competitive effects (number of other airlines 
serving the city-pair) and the airport presence effect are
both strong, as in prior work.
\end{itemize}
}

\frame[plain]
{
\frametitle{Results - Ciliberto and Tamer (2009)}
\begin{itemize}
\item Column 2 allows competitive effects to vary across firms. No longer
a unique number of firms (depends on who enters). Competitive effects 
are similar except for the low-cost carriers
which have a bigger impact, and airport presence stronger yet.\\
\vspace{0.2in}
\item Column 4 allows one airline's presence to affect different airlines differently. Now Large airlines (LAR) and Southwest (=WN) have strongly negative effects on LCC, and there
are smaller differences among the rest.

differences between the primitives that underly agents' decisions and the
econometrician's constructs for those primitives. \\

Let our \textit{observable} approximation to $\pi (.)$\\
\begin{equation*}
r^{I}(d,d_{-i},z_{i}^{o},\theta _{0})
\end{equation*}

\vspace{0.2in}
%%%%%%%%%%%Julie - verify that you agree with my classification of this variable as an "error in
%%%%%%%%%%% the approximation" of pi.
Define the error in this approximation as:
\begin{equation*}
\upsilon (d,d_{-i},z_{i}^{o},z_{i},\theta
_{0})=r^{I}(d,d_{-i},z_{i}^{o},\theta _{0})-\pi (d,d_{-i},z_{i}).
\end{equation*}
}

\frame[plain]
{
\frametitle{The Profit Inequality Approach}


Then by definition:%
\begin{equation*}
r^{I}(d,d_{-i},z_{i}^{o},\theta _{0})=\mathit{\varepsilon }\left[ \pi (d_{i},%
\mathbf{d}_{-i},\mathbf{z}_{i})|\mathit{I}_{i}\right] +\upsilon
_{2,i,d}^{I}+\upsilon _{1,i,d}^{I},
\end{equation*}

where%
\begin{equation*}
\upsilon _{2,i,d}^{I}=\mathit{\varepsilon }\left[ \upsilon
(d,d_{-i},z_{i}^{o},z_{i},\theta _{0})|\mathit{I}_{i}\right]
\end{equation*}

and%
\begin{equation*}
\upsilon _{1,i,d}^{I}=\left( \pi (d,.)-\mathit{\varepsilon }\left[ \pi (d,.)|%
\mathit{I}_{i}\right] \right) +\left( \upsilon (d,;)-\mathit{\varepsilon }\left[
\upsilon (d,.)|\mathit{I}_{i}\right] \right) .
\end{equation*}
We will discuss the sources and interpretation of $\upsilon _{1}^{I}$ and $\upsilon _{2}^{I}$ in the following slides.
}

\frame[plain]
{
\frametitle{The Profit Inequality Approach}

Note: For all $d\in D_{i}$, $\mathit{\varepsilon }\left[ \upsilon _{1,i,d}^{I}|%
\mathit{I}_{i}\right] =0$, by construction, while $\mathit{\varepsilon }\left[
\upsilon _{2,i,d}^{I}|\mathit{I}_{i}\right] \neq 0$. It is this distinction
that forces us to keep track of two separate disturbances and consider their
relative importance.\\

\frame[plain]
{
\frametitle{The Profit Inequality Approach}
\textbf{Sources of $\protect\upsilon _{1}^{I}$:}\\
\vspace{0.2in}
By construction $\upsilon _{1}^{I}$ is the sum of:

\begin{enumerate}
\item Expectational error%
\begin{equation*}
\pi (d,;)-\mathit{\varepsilon }\left[ \pi (d,.)|\mathit{I}_{i}\right]
\end{equation*}%
and

\item Specification and measurement error%
\begin{equation*}
\upsilon (d,;)-\mathit{\varepsilon }\left[ \upsilon (d,.)|\mathit{I}_{i}\right]
\end{equation*}
\end{enumerate}

}

\frame[plain]
{
\frametitle{The Profit Inequality Approach}

The expectational error is caused by:
\begin{enumerate}[i]
\item uncertainty in $\mathbf{z}_{i}$,
and/or 
\item asymmetric information which is uncertainty in $\mathbf{d}_{-i}$%. 
\end{enumerate}
\vspace{0.1in}

So to compute its distribution (as we'd need to if we were using MLE, for
example), we'd have to specify what each agent knew about its competitors,
and then repeatedly solve for an equilibrium (a process which would
typically require us to select among equilibria). \\
\vspace{0.2in}
Since we'd have to compute
returns from a counterfactual, the specification error would probably be
non-trivial. The inequalities methodology does not require this step.

}

\frame[plain]
{
\frametitle{The Profit Inequality Approach}
\textbf{Sources of $\protect\upsilon _{2}^{I}$ and Selection:}\\
\vspace{0.2in}
$\upsilon _{2}^{I}$ is that part of profits that the agent does condition on
when making its decision but the econometrician has not included in the
profit specification. \\
\vspace{0.2in}
Since $\upsilon _{2,i}^{I}\in \mathit{I}_{i}$ and $%
d_{i}=d(\mathit{I}_{i})$, $d_{i}$ will generally be a function of $\upsilon
_{2,i}^{I}$ (and perhaps also of $\upsilon _{2,-i}^{I}$).  \\
\vspace{0.2in}
This can generate a selection problem.

}

\frame[plain]
{
\frametitle{The Profit Inequality Approach}

For example, temporarily ignore any difference between the agent's expectations (our 
$\mathit{\varepsilon }(.)$) and the expectations generated by the true data
generating process (our $E(.)$). \\
\vspace{0.2in}
Assume that $x$ is an ``instrument" in the
sense that $\mathit{\varepsilon }(\upsilon _{2}^{I}|x)=0$, and, in addition,
that $x\in I$. Then:%
\begin{equation*}
\mathit{\varepsilon }(\upsilon _{1}^{I}|x)=\mathit{\varepsilon }(\upsilon
_{2}^{I}|x)=0.
\end{equation*}


}

which depends on $d_{i}$ (ie on the choice made by agent $i$ - all our
inequalities depend on this) requires properties of the disturbance
conditional on $d_{i}$. \\

Since $d$ is measurable given the information set $%
\mathit{I}$, 
\begin{equation*}
\mathit{\varepsilon }(\upsilon _{1}^{I}|x,d)=0.

However, since $\upsilon _{2}\in \mathit{I}$, and 
\begin{equation*}
\mathit{\varepsilon }(\pi (.)|.)=\mathit{\varepsilon }(r(.)|.)-\upsilon _{2},
\end{equation*}

if the agent chooses $d^{\ast }$ then 
\begin{equation*}
\upsilon _{2,d}-\upsilon _{2,d^{\ast }}\geq \mathit{\varepsilon }(r(.,d)|.)-%
\mathit{\varepsilon }(r(.,d^{\ast })|.)
\end{equation*}

so%
\begin{equation*}
\boxed{\mathit{\varepsilon }(\upsilon _{2,d}|x,d)\neq 0.}
\end{equation*}
More intuitively: firms are choosing $d^{\ast }$ based on the observed $%
v_{2,d^{\ast }}$, so it makes sense that there's a selection issue, ie that $%
\mathit{\varepsilon }(\upsilon _{2,d^{\ast }}|x,d^{\ast })\neq 0.$

\frame[plain]
{
\frametitle{The Profit Inequality Approach}
This result
implies that the statement that ``$x$ is an instrument"\ does not ``solve" the
selection problem. Formally%
\begin{equation*}
\mathit{\varepsilon }\left[ \Delta \pi (d_{i},.)|x_{i},d_{i}\right] =\mathit{%
\varepsilon }\left[ \Delta r(d_{i},.)|x_{i},d_{i}\right] -\mathit{\varepsilon }%
\left[ \upsilon _{2,i,d_{i}}^{I}-\upsilon _{2,i,d^{\prime }}^{I}|x_{i},d_{i}%
\right] .
\end{equation*}

Theory gives us $\mathit{\varepsilon }\left[ \Delta \pi (d_{i},.)|x_{i},d_{i}%
\right] \geq 0$, but this only implies 
\begin{equation*}
\mathit{\varepsilon }\left[ \Delta r(d_{i},.)|x_{i},d_{i}\right] \geq 0
\end{equation*}

if 
\begin{equation*}
\mathit{\varepsilon }\left[ \upsilon _{2,i,d_{i}}^{I}-\upsilon _{2,i,d^{\prime
}}^{I}|x_{i},d_{i}\right] \geq 0,
\end{equation*}

and \textit{this requires additional conditions on the measurement model. }We will come back to these conditions
shortly.\\ (See IC4.)

strategies, or the distribution of $(\mathbf{d}_{-i},\mathbf{z}_{i})$
conditional on $\mathit{I}_{i}$.

we do not need to fully specify how the agent forms its expectations.

agents' expectations on $\Delta \pi (.,\theta _{0})$ and the expectation of
the data generating process are mean-zero conditional on $x$ (in that case
the expression is satisfied with equality). Or

profits from the decisions they make.

but not the econometrician. \item Take $d^{\prime }(j)=j+1$. The difference in
profits will always contain $\upsilon _{2}$, now interpreted as the cost
savings from not purchasing the additional unit. \item We will take an
unconditional average across this cost (not conditional on the choice). \item This
is the method used in Ishii\ (2005).

and a saving to the buyer if the contract is not accepted.

it out by adding together the inequality of the buyer and that of the

Katz's problem was to estimate the costs shoppers assign to driving to a
supermarket. \\
\vspace{0.2in}
These costs are important for the choice of supermarket
locations and, as a result, for the analysis of the impact of zoning
regulations. \\
\vspace{0.2in}
They have been difficult to analyze empirically with standard
choice models because of the complexity of the choice set facing consumers
(all possible bundles of goods at all supermarkets).

Assume that the agents' utility functions are additively separable functions
of:\begin{itemize} \item the utility from the basket of goods the agent buys, \item expenditure on that basket, and \item drive time to the supermarket. \end{itemize}
\vspace{0.1in}
Since utilities are only defined up to a monotone transformation, there is a free normalization for each individual. Katz normalizes the coefficient on expenditure for each individual to equal one. \\
\vspace{0.2in}
He allows for heterogeneity in the cost of
drive time that is known to the agents when they make their decision but
unobserved by the econometrician.  This will be one component of $\upsilon
_{2,i}$.

Possible counterfactuals:
Purchase of any bundle of goods at any store. \\

For a particular $d_{i}$ choose $d^{\prime }(d_{i})$ to be the purchase of

\item at a store which is further away from the consumer's home than the
store the consumer shopped at.

I.e. if $e(d)$ and $dt(d)$ provide
the expenditure and the drive time for store choice $d$, and $(\theta

expenditure),%

Assuming, as seems reasonable, that $(dt\left( d_{i}),dt\left( d^{\prime

dt(j)-dt(d^{\prime }(j))<0$ by choice of alternative implies that:%
\begin{equation*}
\mathit{\varepsilon }\left[ \sum_{j}\chi \left\{ d_{i}=j\right\} \left( \frac{%
e(j)-e(d^{\prime }(j))}{dt(d^{\prime }(j))-dt(j)}-(\theta +\upsilon

Let $\theta $ be the average of the cost of drive time across consumers, so $%

E\left[ \frac{1}{N}\sum_{i}\left( \frac{e(d_{i})-e(d^{\prime }(d_{i}))}{%
dt(d^{\prime }(d_{i}))-dt(d_{i})}\right) \right] -\theta \leq 0,\text{ }at%

This result provides a lower bound to $\theta $. \\
\vspace{0.2in}
Were we to consider a second
alternative in which the bundle of goods purchased was the same as in the
actual choice but the counterfactual store required \textit{less drive time}%
, we would also get an upper bound to $\theta _{0}$. \\
\vspace{0.2in}
Katz (2007) shows that
these bounds are quite informative and provides a range for the average cost
of drive time which accords with auxiliary information, while more standard
discrete choice estimators do not.

To obtain these inequalities we chose an alternative that allowed us to
difference out the impact of the bundle of goods chosen on utility
(differencing out our "group" effect).\\
\vspace{0.2in}
We then rearranged these differences
to form a moment which was linear in the remaining source of $\upsilon _{2}$
variance no matter $d_{i}$ (the source being differences in the costs of
travel time). }

\frametitle{Estimation from Profit Inequalities - Katz (2007)}
If we were interested in the impact of a particular good
purchased on utility, we would have considered baskets of goods which
differed only in that good and goods which had cross partials with that good
in the utility function, at the \textit{same} supermarket (thus differencing
out the effects of travel time and other components of utility). \\

options would present themselves were we to have data on multiple shopping
