\section{Overview}
%--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

\begin{frame}{Overview}
In this lecture we explore recent approaches to estimating models through the use of inequality restrictions, rather than equality restrictions.  \\
\vspace{0.2in}
The motivation for these approaches comes from:

\begin{itemize}
\item Economic problems that cannot be empirically investigated with
more standard techniques (e.g., discrete games)

\item Sampling methodology or measurement limitations in data (e.g. we don't know an agent's exact income, but we know whether it lies in an
interval, so we can get inequalities on income; or
we have topcoded income)
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

%--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

\begin{frame}{Overview}
\begin{itemize}
\item The assumptions required in the latter case to ensure that moment
inequalities estimators have desirable properties are quite straightforward.
\vspace{0.1in}
\item The assumptions required in the former case are more subtle. 
\vspace{0.1in}
\item Once we investigate these assumptions, we may start questioning the assumptions underlying the estimators of more traditional behavioral problems (particularly those that require discrete actions in a game or assume full information about all players, etc.).
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

%--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\begin{frame}{Overview}
\begin{itemize}
\item The appeal of using moment inequalities to analyze a behavioral model is
that the set up for the econometric problem is often the same as the set up for a
theoretical model.
\vspace{0.1in}
\item This similarity makes it easy to interpret the results in a way that
is consistent with the theory.
\vspace{0.1in}
\item However, dealing with unobservables can be tricky in this context.
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

%--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\section{Economic Model}
%--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

\begin{frame}{Econometric Framework}
\begin{itemize}
\item We know how to estimate models based on moment conditions like:
\begin{eqnarray*}
E[g(z_i, \theta)] = 0
\end{eqnarray*}
\item But instead we might form moments like:
\begin{eqnarray*}
E[h(z_i, \theta)] \leq 0
\end{eqnarray*}
either in addition to our moments that hold with equality, or as a replacement for.
\item Instead of identifying a single point $\hat{\theta}$ our restrictions might only \alert{identify a set} $S(\Theta)$.
\item Both estimation and inference are going to work differently in this world.
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

%--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

\begin{frame}{Economic Model}
\begin{itemize}
\item The econometrician observes a set of choices made by various agents.
\vspace{0.1in}
\item Assume agents expect the choices they made to lead to returns that are
higher than the returns they would have earned had they made an
alternative feasible choice.
\vspace{0.1in}
\item Assume a parametric \textit{return function}.
\vspace{0.1in}
\item For each value of $\theta $, compute the difference between the observable part of the actual realized returns and the observable part of returns the agents would have earned had they made the alternative choice.
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

%--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

\begin{frame}{Economic Model}
\begin{itemize}
\item Estimator:\ Accept any value of $\theta $ that, on average, makes the
observed decisions better (more profitable)\ than the alternative.
\vspace{0.1in}
\item Question:\ When do such (possibly set valued) estimators enable us to
make valid inferences on the parameters of interest?
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

%--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

\begin{frame}{Economic Model}
There is more than one set of conditions that can be used to justify
inequality estimators.  We will consider the following two such sets of conditions:\\
\begin{itemize}
\vspace{0.1in}
\item Those that use only ``structural errors'' (i.e., assumptions
that are the multiple-agent analog of the assumptions used in discrete
choice econometrics). \\
\vspace{0.1in}
\item Those that incorporate expectational and measurement errors along with the structural errors.\\
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

%--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\begin{frame}{Economic Model}
\begin{itemize}
\item  Ciliberto and Tamer \textit{(Econometrica 2009)} develop the estimator based on the first set of conditions in the context of an entry model.\\
\vspace{0.1in}
\item Pakes, Porter, Ho and Ishii \textit{(Econometrica 2015)} develop the estimator based on the second set of conditions.\\
\vspace{0.1in}
\item  Pakes\ \textit{(Econometrica 2010)} provides a comparison of the two sets of conditions.\\
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

%--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\section{Conditions Common to the Two Inequality Estimators}
%--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

\begin{frame}{Four Conditions Required for Discrete Games}
\begin{itemize}
\item Let $\pi(\cdot)$ be the payoffs, 
\item $d_i$ and $\mathbf{d_{-i}}$ be the agent's and its competitors' choices
\item $\mathbf{y_i}$ be any variable (other than the decision variables) that affects the agent's payoffs
\item $D_i$ be the choice set, and $\Omega_i$ be the agent's information set.  
\item \large{$\varepsilon[ \cdot | \Omega_i]$} \normalsize is the agent's expectation conditional on the information set $\Omega_i$.
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

%--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

\begin{frame}{Nash Condition (C1)}
\begin{equation*}
\sup_{d\in D_{i},d\neq d_{i}}\varepsilon\left[ \pi (d,\mathbf{d}_{-i},\mathbf{y}_{i},\theta _{0})|\Omega_i \right] \leq \varepsilon\left[ \pi (d_{i},\mathbf{d}_{-i},\mathbf{y}_{i},\theta _{0})| \Omega_i \right] 
\end{equation*}
where $D_{i}\subset D$, for $i=1,...,n$.
\begin{itemize}
\footnotesize
\item No restriction on choice set; could be discrete (e.g., all bilateral
contracts) or continuous (if so, the optimum could be at a corner and the objective function may
have non-convexities), or a combination of discrete/continuous (e.g. a carbon tax on gas consumption may affect consumers' choices of car and the number of miles
traveled conditional on car choice).
\item C1 is a necessary condition for a Nash equilibrium, and is meant to be a rationality assumption (i.e., the agent's choice is optimal wrt his beliefs).  However, it does not imply uniqueness, and equilibrium selection can differ across observations.
\item To check the Nash Condition, we need an approximation to what profits \textit{%
would have been} had the agent made a choice which in fact he did not make.
This requires a model of how the agent thinks that $\mathbf{d}_{-i}$ and $%
\mathbf{y}_{i}$ are likely to change in response to a change in the agent's
decision. 
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}
%--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

\begin{frame}{Counterfactual Condition (C2)}
\footnotesize
The model for how the agent thinks $(\mathbf{y_i, d_{-i}})$ are likely to
respond to changes in $d_i$ may depend on other variables, say $z_i$, but we require $z_i$ to be exogenous (i.e., the agent believes $z_i$ will not change if the agent changes its own
decision). \\ \vspace{0.2in}
\noindent Condition C2 formalizes this assumption.
\begin{equation*}
\mathbf{d}_{-i}=d^{-i}(\mathbf{d}_{i},\mathbf{z}_{i}),\text{ \ }\mathbf{y}%
_{i}=y(\mathbf{z}_{i},\mathbf{d}_{i},\mathbf{d}_{-i}),\text{ }and
\end{equation*}
the distribution of $\mathbf{z}_{i}$ conditional on $\mathit{I}_{i}$ does
not depend on $d_{i}$.
\begin{itemize}
%\item The assumption that the distribution of $\mathbf{z}_{i}$ conditional
%on $\mathit{I}_{i}$ does not depend on $d_{i}$ is what we mean by $\mathbf{z}%
%_{i}$ being an exogenous random variable.
\item If we have simultaneous moves then $d^{-i}(d',\mathbf{z_i}) = \mathbf{d}_{-i}$ (i.e., there is no need for an explicit model of reactions by competitors, and Condition C2 is satisfied.)
\item If there are sequential decisions and we want to use the decision of the first player in the analysis,
then we have to specify a model for what the first player
thinks the second player would do were the first player to
change his decision.
\item If there is a $\mathbf{y}$ which is ``endogenous" - i.e. its distribution depends on $d_{i}$ - then we
need a model of that dependence.
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

%--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\begin{frame}{Implications of conditions C1 and C2:}
If $d^{\prime }\in D_{i}$ and 
\begin{equation*}
\Delta \pi (d_{i},d^{\prime },d_{-i},z_{i})=\pi (d_{i},d_{-i},z_{i})-\pi
(d^{\prime },d_{-i},z_{i})
\end{equation*}
then%
\begin{equation*}
\mathit{\varepsilon }\left[ \Delta \pi (d_{i},d^{\prime },\mathbf{d}_{-i},%
\mathbf{z}_{i})| \Omega_i \right] \geq 0.
\end{equation*}
To use this inequality directly as a basis for an estimation algorithm, we need the
relationships between:
\begin{itemize}
\item The expectations underlying agents' decisions ($\mathit{\varepsilon }(.)$%
) and the expectations of the observed sample moments ($E(.)$),
\item $\pi (.,\theta )$ and $(z\,_{i},d_{i},d_{-i})$ and their observable
analogues.
\end{itemize}
\vspace{0.2cm}
This is where the two approaches differ.  We covered the first set in the last lecture.
\end{frame}

%--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

\begin{frame}{Entry Models with Structural Errors, Example}
\small
Before specifying the next two conditions, consider the information structure of a simple 2-firm entry model. Let $a_i \in \{0,1 \}$ denote the action of player $i = 1,2$. The profits are given by:
\begin{equation*}
\begin{split}
\Pi_i (s) =& \left \{
\begin{array}{l} 
\beta' \text{s} - \delta a_{-i} + \epsilon_i , \;\; \text{if } a_i = 1 \\
0 \;\; \;\; \;\; \text{otherwise}
\end{array}
\right. 
\end{split}
\end{equation*}
where $s$ denotes market-level control variables. 
\vfill
Firm entry choices are interdependent, in the sense that firm 1's profits from entering (and, hence, his decision to enter) depend on whether firm 2 is in the market. \\
\vfill
As before, the error terms $\epsilon_i$ are assumed to be observed by both firms, but not by the econometrician. This is a ``perfect information" game. 
(Seim (2006) considers an ``incomplete information" game.)
\end{frame}
%--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

\begin{frame}{Entry Models with Structural Errors, Example}
For fixed values of the errors $\epsilon \equiv (\epsilon_1, \epsilon_2)$ and parameters $\theta \equiv (\alpha_1, \alpha_2, \beta_1, \beta_2)$, the Nash equilibrium values $a^*_1, a^*_2$ must satisfy best-response conditions. For fixed $(\theta, \epsilon)$, the best-response conditions are:
\begin{equation*}
\begin{split}
a^*_1 = & 1 \Leftrightarrow \Pi_1 (a^*_2) \geq 0 \\
a^*_1 = & 0 \Leftrightarrow \Pi_1 (a^*_2) < 0 \\
a^*_2 = & 1 \Leftrightarrow \Pi_2 (a^*_1) \geq 0 \\
a^*_2 = & 0 \Leftrightarrow \Pi_2 (a^*_1) < 0
\end{split}
\end{equation*}
\end{frame}
%--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

\begin{frame}{Entry Models with Structural Errors, Example}
For some values of parameters, there may be multiple equilibria. Define the mutually exclusive outcome indicators:
\begin{equation*}
\begin{split}
Y_1 = & 1 (a_1 = 1, a_2 = 0) \\
Y_2 = & 1 (a_1 = 0, a_2 = 1) \\
Y_3 = & 1 (a_1 = 0, a_2 = 0) \\
Y_4 = & 1 (a_1 = 1, a_2 = 1) 
\end{split}
\end{equation*}
\end{frame}
%--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

\begin{frame}{Entry Models with Structural Errors, Example}
The moment inequalities for the Nash equilibrium assumptions are:
\begin{equation*}
\begin{split}
\bullet & [1- \Phi(-\beta 's)][\Phi(\delta - \beta 's)] \geq E[Y_1 \mid s] \geq [1 -\Phi(-\beta 's)] \Phi(-\beta 's) + \\ 
& [1 - \Phi(\delta - \beta 's)][\Phi(\delta - \beta 's) - \Phi(-\beta 's)] \\ \\
\bullet & [1- \Phi(-\beta 's)][\Phi(\delta - \beta 's)] \geq E[Y_2 \mid s] \geq [1 -\Phi(-\beta 's)] \Phi(-\beta 's) + \\ 
& [1 - \Phi(\delta - \beta 's)][\Phi(\delta - \beta 's) - \Phi(-\beta 's)] \\ \\
\bullet & [\Phi(-\beta 's)]^2 \geq E[Y_3 \mid s] \geq [\Phi (-\beta 's)]^2 \\ \\
\bullet & [1 - \Phi (\delta - \beta 's)]^2 \geq E[Y_4 \mid s] \geq [1 - \Phi (\delta - \beta 's)]^2
\end{split}
\end{equation*}
\end{frame}
%--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\begin{frame}{Entry Models with Structural Errors, Example}
We've already seen one alternative remedy to this problem. 
\begin{itemize}
\item Instead of modeling events $Y_1 = 1 \text{ and } Y_2 = 1$ separately ...
\item Model the aggregate event $Y_5 \equiv Y_1 + Y_2 = 1$, which is the event that \emph{only one firm} enters.
\item In other words, just model the likelihood of \emph{number of entrants}, but not the identities of entrants. This was done in Berry's (1992) paper. 
\item More recently, researchers attempt to more flexibly address the problem of multiple equilibria by:
\begin{enumerate} 
\item Generalizing the information structure of the game
\item Working directly with the moment inequalities.  How these models are taken to data differ based on the assumptions that the researcher puts on the model's sources of error (and on the information structure of the game).
\end{enumerate}
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}
%--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

\begin{frame}{Approach \#1: No Specification Error}
\vspace{2mm}
Early papers focus on games where the moment (in)equalities are generated by ``structural" errors only (i.e. those observed by firms, but not by the econometrician).  
\begin{itemize}
\item Early versions of these models select an equilibrium ex-ante: Bresnahan and Reiss (1991 and others), Berry (1992), Mazzeo (2003), and Seim (2006).  
\item Ciliberto and Tamer (2009) follow this approach too, but allow for multiple equilibria.  As a result of this, the parameters of their model are ``set identified,'' as we will see later on.
\end{itemize}
Each of these models are Full Information models except Seim; she introduces Asymmetric Information between firms but otherwise assumes no specification error.\\
\end{frame}
%--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

\begin{frame}{Approach \#2: Expectational and Measurement Error}
\vspace{2mm}
\begin{itemize}
\item More recently, estimation of discrete games has evolved to consider the case where the moment (in)equalities are generated by non-structural, expectational errors, which are not known by agents at the time that their decisions are made.
\item This approach is broader than the entry literature per se, and follows the approach taken in Pakes, Porter, Ho, and Ishii. 
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}


%--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\section{Extra Conditions under Full\ Information and No Specification Error}
%--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\begin{frame}{Expectational Condition (FC3)}

\begin{equation*}
\pi (d,d_{-i},z_{i},\theta _{0})=\varepsilon \left[ \pi (d,\mathbf{d}%
_{-i},\mathbf{z}_{i},\theta _{0})| \Omega_i \right] \text{ \hspace{0.1in}} \forall  \text{ \hspace{0.1in}} d\in D_{i}
\end{equation*}
\begin{itemize}
\item FC3 implies that the model does not allow for any expectational error. That
is, it rules out asymmetric and/or incomplete information.
\item The first assumption ensures that other agents' actions ($d_{-i}$) are known with certainty at the time
the agent makes its decision, and the second ensures that the agent knows $z_{i}$ with certainty at the time its decision is made. 
\item  Note this restricts $D_i$ to pure strategies.  At a cost of notational complexity the model could be augmented to account for sequential games.
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}
%--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

\begin{frame}{Measurement Condition (FC4)}
\begin{equation*}
\pi (.,\theta )\text{ is known.}
\end{equation*}%
\begin{equation*}
z_{i}=(\upsilon _{2,i}^{f},z_{i}^{o})\text{ },\text{ }%
(d_{i},d_{-i},z_{i}^{o},z_{-i}^{o})\text{ observed,}
\end{equation*}%
\begin{equation*}
(\upsilon _{2,i}^{f},\upsilon _{2,-i}^{f})|_{z_{i}^{o},z_{-i}^{o}}\sim
F(.;\theta )\text{, }F(.,\theta )\text{ is known.}
\end{equation*}
\begin{itemize}
\item FC4 says that the model does not allow for any specification or measurement
error. 
\item Our functional form for the profit equation is exactly the
same as that of the agents.
\item Some of the $z_{i}$ are observed by the
econometrician (the $z_{i}^{o}$) and some are not ($\upsilon _{2,i}^{f}$).
\item The agents know $(\upsilon _{2,i}^{f},\upsilon _{2,-i}^{f})$ (from FC3), though the
econometrician does not.
\item The econometrician knows their joint distribution.
\item  We will see below that these assumptions provide a lot of power.
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}
%--------------------------------------------------------------------------------


\begin{frame}{Implications of FC3 and FC4}

Substituting FC3 and FC4 into the moment inequality gives:

\begin{equation*}
\Delta \pi (d_{i},d^{\prime },d_{-i},z_{i}^{o},\upsilon _{2,i}^{f};\theta
_{0})\geq 0,
\end{equation*}

$\forall d\in D_{i}$, and%
\begin{equation*}
(\upsilon _{2,i}^{f},\upsilon _{2,-i}^{f})|_{z_{i}^{o},z_{-i}^{o}}\sim
F(.;\theta _{0}).
\end{equation*}

This is almost enough to build an estimation algorithm. It does leave the
logical problem that there may not be a $\theta $ that satisfies these
conditions for all vectors of decisions. To ensure that the model assigns
positive probability to the observed decisions for some $\theta $ we
typically also assume additive separability:%
\begin{equation*}
\pi (d_{i},d_{-i},z_{i}^{o},\upsilon _{2,i}^{f})=\pi
^{as}(d,d_{-i},z_{i}^{o},\theta _{0})+\upsilon _{2,i,d}^{f},
\end{equation*}

and that the distribution $\upsilon _{2,i}^{f}$ conditional on $\upsilon
_{2,-i}^{f}$ has full support.
\end{frame}
%--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

\begin{frame}{Notes on FC3 and FC4}
Notes:

\small
\begin{itemize}
%\item FC3 and FC4 are implicit in the standard single agent discrete choice
%literature, so all my comments apply to that literature also.

\item The additive separability of $\upsilon _{2,i,d}^{f}$ cannot be
obtained definitionally, by assuming $\upsilon _{2}$ is a residual from a
projection because the RHS contains a
decision variable which depends on $\upsilon _{2}$. In the single-agent discrete choice literature we can solve out for the $d_{i}$ to obtain a function that depends only on ``exogenous" variables.
Here we can't because $d_{-i}$ is on the right hand side,
and by assumption the $-i$ agents know $\upsilon _{2,i}$ when making their
decisions.
\item Early work on entry looked for a useful reduced form (one that could be used to summarize the effects of environmental characteristics of the market on number of participating agents). It typically assumed orthogonality of the error and solved for the optimal decision of each agent (enter or not). This work tended to find that the implied profits increased with the number of competitors. This was because more firms entered in more profitable markets (alternatively the error had components that were common to all participating agents, and hence were correlated with $d_{-i}$).
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}
%--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

\begin{frame}{Notes on FC3 and FC4}
\small
\begin{itemize}
\item Although the usual reduced-form assumptions used to generate discrete choice models do not do well when there are interacting agents, there is always a reduced-form for the single agent model that does make sense.  (Regress profits on variables of interest, assume a conditional distribution of the error, compute the choice as a function of the error, and form a standard estimator.)  It is the fact that this does not work for multiple agent problems that lead to the developments below.
\item Suppose we wanted a reduced form for our problem. We could regress $\pi^{as}(\cdot)$ on variables of interest (e.g. $d_{-i}$ and other things). Were we to do so, we would pick up an additional error which is by construction, orthogonal to the included variables. Then we would have to deal with both errors in estimation, and they have different properties. The models we describe next, are going after such a reduced form, but they do not allow for the latter error. So there is a question of how any logical inconsistency affects the results.
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\section{Estimation from Inequality Conditions (Structural Errors Only)}
%--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

\begin{frame}{\normalsize Estimation from Inequality Conditions (Structural Errors Only)}
This section follows Ciliberto and Tamer (2009), which studies entry in the airline industry.\\
\vspace{0.1in}
Start with the  formulation of profit in Berry (1992):

\begin{equation*}
\Pi_{m,k,N} =X_{m} \beta - \delta \text{log} N + Z_k \alpha +  (\rho u_{m0} + \sqrt{1- \rho^2} u_{mk})
\end{equation*}

\begin{itemize}
\item $(X_{m} \beta - \delta \text{log} N) $ is the observable component of profit that is common to all firms in a market
\item $Z_k \alpha$ is the observable component of profit that varies across firms within a market. 
\item The unobserved components of profit also have a common component $(\rho u_{m0}) $ and a firm-specific component ($\sqrt{1- \rho^2} u_{mk}$).
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}
%--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\begin{frame}{\normalsize Estimation from Inequality Conditions (Structural Errors Only)}
Ciliberto and Tamer allow for a more flexible profit function, seen here:

\begin{equation*}
\Pi_{m,i} =S_m'\alpha + Z_{im}' \beta_i + W_{im}'\gamma_i + \sum_{j \neq i} \delta_{j}^{i}y_{jm} + \sum_{j \neq i} Z_{jm}'\phi_j^i y_{jm} + \epsilon_{im}
\end{equation*}

\noindent
\footnotesize
\begin{itemize}
\item $S_m$ denotes market characteristics common to all firms
\item $Z_{im}$ is a vector of firm characteristics that enter into the profits of all firms in the market (e.g., product attributes that consumers value)
\item $W_{im}$ is a vector of firm characteristics that only affect firm $i$'s profit in market $m$
\item $y_{jm}$ is an indicator for the presence of other firms $j\neq i$ in market $m$
\item $\delta_{j}^{i}$ captures the effect of having firm $j$ in market $m$ on firm $i$'s profit
\item $\phi_j^i$ captures firm-interaction effects that arise through the $Z_m$'s.
\item $\epsilon_{im}$ has several components: destination, origin, airport, and a firm-market unobservable.  This maps to the $\upsilon_{2,i}$ error in our notes, and is assumed to be observed by all players.
%$K$ is the number of potential entrants in market $m$\\
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

%--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\begin{frame}{\normalsize Estimation from Inequality Conditions (Structural Errors Only)}
We can write down the conditions from the theoretical model (C1 and C2) given this profit function, as well as the conditions that allow us to translate the theoretical model to the data in a perfect information, ``structural errors'' world (FC3 and FC4).  \\
\vspace{0.2in} 
Note that although the model
does specify a parametric distribution for the $(\upsilon
_{2,i}^{f},\upsilon _{2,-i}^{f})$ conditional on the observables, it does
not deliver a likelihood.  \\
\vspace{0.2in} There is no function that takes values of the $%
z^{o},\upsilon _{2}$ and $\theta $ vectors into uniquely-specified actions,
so we cannot construct probabilities for those actions.  \\
\vspace{0.2in} 
This result comes directly from the inequalities of the entry game, and is due to the possibility of multiple equilibria.  
\end{frame}
%--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

\begin{frame}{\normalsize Results/Conditions that the Inequalities with FC3 and FC4 Deliver}

\begin{enumerate}
\item We can check whether the conditions of the model are satisfied at the
observed $(d_{i},d_{-i})$ for any $(\upsilon _{2,i}^{f},\upsilon
_{2,-i}^{f}) $ and $\theta $, and this, together with $F(.,\theta )$,
enables us to calculate the probability of those conditions being satisfied
at any $\theta $. \\
\vspace{0.2 in} 
These are necessary conditions for the choice to be made:\
therefore when $\theta =\theta _{0}$ the probability of satisfying them must
be weakly greater than the probability of observing $(d_{i},d_{-i})$. \\
\vspace{0.2 in} 
I.e. the model delivers an \textit{outer measure}\ for the actions conditional on $%
\theta $.
\end{enumerate}
\end{frame}
%--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

\begin{frame}{\normalsize Results/Conditions that the Inequalities with FC3 and FC4 Deliver}
\begin{enumerate}
\setcounter{enumi}{1}
\item We can check whether $(d_{i},d_{-i})$ are the only values of the
decision variables to satisfy the necessary conditions for any $(\upsilon
_{2,i}^{f},\upsilon _{2,-i}^{f})$ and $\theta $, and this can be used to
provide a lower bound on the probability of actually observing $%
(d_{i},d_{-i})$ given $\theta $. \\
\vspace{0.2in}
When $\theta =\theta _{0}$ the probability
that we observe these decisions is weakly greater than the probability that
they're the only values that are consistent with the model. \\
\vspace{0.2 in} 
I.e., the model also delivers an \textit{inner measure} for the action conditional on $\theta $.
\end{enumerate}
\end{frame}
%--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

\begin{frame}{\normalsize Results/Conditions that the Inequalities with FC3 and FC4 Deliver}
More formally, define the probability that the model generated by C1, C2,
FC3 and FC4 with the additive separability constraint, a model we will call
MF, is satisfied at a particular $(d_{i},d_{-i})$ for a given $\theta $ to
be: 
\begin{equation*}
\bar{P}\left\{ (d_{i},d_{-i})|\theta \right\} =\Pr \left\{ (\upsilon
_{2,i}^{f},\upsilon _{2,-i}^{f}):(d_{i},d_{-i})\text{ satisfy MF}%
|z_{i}^{o},z_{-i}^{o},\theta \right\} ,
\end{equation*}%
and the analogous lower bound to be:%

Were we to know the equilibrium selection mechanism we could also calculate
the actual likelihood of $(d_{i},d_{-i})$ for a given $\theta $ or%
\begin{equation*}
P\left\{ (d_{i},d_{-i})|\theta \right\} =\Pr \left\{
(d_{i},d_{-i})|z_{i}^{o},z_{-i}^{o},\theta \right\} .
\end{equation*}

We \textit{do not know} the selection mechanism but we do know that for the true
selection mechanism when $\theta =\theta _{0}$%
\begin{equation*}
\boxed{\bar{P}\left\{ (d_{i},d_{-i})|\theta \right\} \geq P\left\{
(d_{i},d_{-i})|\theta \right\} \geq \text{\b{P}}\left\{

constructed from the condition on \b{P}$\left\{ (d_{i},d_{-i})|\theta

\begin{frame}{Estimation Routine - Ciliberto and Tamer (2009)}
The estimation routine:
\begin{itemize}
\item constructs unbiased estimates of $(\b{P}(\cdot|\theta),\bar{P}(\cdot|\theta))$, 
\item substitutes them for the true values of the probability bounds into these moments, and
\item accepts values of  $\theta$ for which the moment inequalities are satisfied.
\end{itemize}
\vspace{0.1in}
Since typically neither the upper nor the lower bound are
analytic functions of $\theta$, we employ simulation techniques to obtain an unbiased estimate of them.\\
\vspace{0.2in}
\end{frame}
%--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\begin{frame}{Estimation Routine - Ciliberto and Tamer (2009)}This process can be computationally expensive, often too computationally burdensome
to do. \\
\vspace{0.2in}
We can get away with fewer function evaluations if
we want to rely only on the upper bound probability $\bar{P}( \cdot | \theta))$, as
then we can drop as many comparisons as we want, though by
dropping inequalities you are likely to widen the set of  $\theta$ the
model accepts.
\end{frame}

%--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\begin{frame}{Data - Ciliberto and Tamer (2009)}
The same data used in Berry (1992):
\begin{itemize}
\item DB1B data from 2001 (no price data).  
\item A market is a trip between two airports and a direction, regardless of stops. 
\item The data covers a sample of markets between the top 100 MSA's; 2742 markets.   \item Ciliberto and Tamer focus on strategic interactions between American, Delta, United, and Southwest and pay particular attention to Dallas because of the Wright Amendment.  
\item They construct Berry's ``airport presence'' variable; they do not have cost data, but they have plane capacities and they use that to construct an opportunity fixed cost of serving a market.
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}
%--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\begin{frame}{Results - Ciliberto and Tamer (2009)}
\small
Tables 3 and 4 in Ciliberto and Tamer report confidence intervals for points (i.e. the probability that the confidence set covers the identified set is .95). Table 3 assumes iid errors.  \\
\begin{itemize}
\item The first column constrains competitive effects of each firm's presence in the market on other firms to be the
same.  So, as in Berry (1992) there is a unique number of
firms. The competitive effects (number of other airlines 
serving the city-pair) and the airport presence effect are
both strong, as in prior work.
\item Column 2 allows competitive effects to vary across firms. No longer
a unique number of firms (depends on who enters). Competitive effects 
are similar except for the low-cost carriers
which have a bigger impact, and airport presence stronger yet.\\
\item Column 4 allows one airline's presence to affect different airlines differently. Now Large airlines (LAR) and Southwest (=WN) have strongly negative effects on LCC, and there
are smaller differences among the rest.

Main Idea
\begin{itemize}

	\item Model the supply side negotiation between hospitals and plans in forming equilibrium networks, which determines the division of profits
        \item To increase their share of the surplus from contracting, hospitals have incentives to:
         \begin{itemize}
	\item Invest in quality to attract more patients, lower costs

This approach allows for
differences between the primitives that underly agents' decisions and the
econometrician's constructs for those primitives. \\
\vspace{0.2in}
We start with the
measurement model that provides the relationship between these two objects.

Let our \textit{observable} approximation to $\pi (.)$\\
\begin{equation*}
r^{I}(d,d_{-i},z_{i}^{o},\theta _{0})
\end{equation*}

\vspace{0.2in}
%%%%%%%%%%%Julie - verify that you agree with my classification of this variable as an "error in
%%%%%%%%%%% the approximation" of pi.
Define the error in this approximation as:
\begin{equation*}
\upsilon (d,d_{-i},z_{i}^{o},z_{i},\theta
_{0})=r^{I}(d,d_{-i},z_{i}^{o},\theta _{0})-\pi (d,d_{-i},z_{i}).
\end{equation*}
}

\frame[plain]
{
\frametitle{The Profit Inequality Approach}


Then by definition:%
\begin{equation*}
r^{I}(d,d_{-i},z_{i}^{o},\theta _{0})=\mathit{\varepsilon }\left[ \pi (d_{i},%
\mathbf{d}_{-i},\mathbf{z}_{i})|\mathit{I}_{i}\right] +\upsilon
_{2,i,d}^{I}+\upsilon _{1,i,d}^{I},
\end{equation*}

where%
\begin{equation*}
\upsilon _{2,i,d}^{I}=\mathit{\varepsilon }\left[ \upsilon
(d,d_{-i},z_{i}^{o},z_{i},\theta _{0})|\mathit{I}_{i}\right]
\end{equation*}

and%
\begin{equation*}
\upsilon _{1,i,d}^{I}=\left( \pi (d,.)-\mathit{\varepsilon }\left[ \pi (d,.)|%
\mathit{I}_{i}\right] \right) +\left( \upsilon (d,;)-\mathit{\varepsilon }\left[
\upsilon (d,.)|\mathit{I}_{i}\right] \right) .
\end{equation*}
We will discuss the sources and interpretation of $\upsilon _{1}^{I}$ and $\upsilon _{2}^{I}$ in the following slides.
}

\frame[plain]
{
\frametitle{The Profit Inequality Approach}

Note: For all $d\in D_{i}$, $\mathit{\varepsilon }\left[ \upsilon _{1,i,d}^{I}|%
\mathit{I}_{i}\right] =0$, by construction, while $\mathit{\varepsilon }\left[
\upsilon _{2,i,d}^{I}|\mathit{I}_{i}\right] \neq 0$. It is this distinction
that forces us to keep track of two separate disturbances and consider their
relative importance.\\
\vspace{0.2in}


}

\frame[plain]
{
\frametitle{The Profit Inequality Approach}
\textbf{Sources of $\protect\upsilon _{1}^{I}$:}\\
\vspace{0.2in}
By construction $\upsilon _{1}^{I}$ is the sum of:

\begin{enumerate}
\item Expectational error%
\begin{equation*}
\pi (d,;)-\mathit{\varepsilon }\left[ \pi (d,.)|\mathit{I}_{i}\right]
\end{equation*}%
and

\item Specification and measurement error%
\begin{equation*}
\upsilon (d,;)-\mathit{\varepsilon }\left[ \upsilon (d,.)|\mathit{I}_{i}\right]
\end{equation*}
\end{enumerate}

}

\frame[plain]
{
\frametitle{The Profit Inequality Approach}

The expectational error is caused by:
\begin{enumerate}[i]
\item uncertainty in $\mathbf{z}_{i}$,
and/or 
\item asymmetric information which is uncertainty in $\mathbf{d}_{-i}$%. 
\end{enumerate}
\vspace{0.1in}

So to compute its distribution (as we'd need to if we were using MLE, for
example), we'd have to specify what each agent knew about its competitors,
and then repeatedly solve for an equilibrium (a process which would
typically require us to select among equilibria). \\
\vspace{0.2in}
Since we'd have to compute
returns from a counterfactual, the specification error would probably be
non-trivial. The inequalities methodology does not require this step.

}

\frame[plain]
{
\frametitle{The Profit Inequality Approach}
\textbf{Sources of $\protect\upsilon _{2}^{I}$ and Selection:}\\
\vspace{0.2in}
$\upsilon _{2}^{I}$ is that part of profits that the agent does condition on
when making its decision but the econometrician has not included in the
profit specification. \\
\vspace{0.2in}
Since $\upsilon _{2,i}^{I}\in \mathit{I}_{i}$ and $%
d_{i}=d(\mathit{I}_{i})$, $d_{i}$ will generally be a function of $\upsilon
_{2,i}^{I}$ (and perhaps also of $\upsilon _{2,-i}^{I}$).  \\
\vspace{0.2in}
This can generate a selection problem.

}

\frame[plain]
{
\frametitle{The Profit Inequality Approach}

For example, temporarily ignore any difference between the agent's expectations (our 
$\mathit{\varepsilon }(.)$) and the expectations generated by the true data
generating process (our $E(.)$). \\
\vspace{0.2in}
Assume that $x$ is an ``instrument" in the
sense that $\mathit{\varepsilon }(\upsilon _{2}^{I}|x)=0$, and, in addition,
that $x\in I$. Then:%
\begin{equation*}
\mathit{\varepsilon }(\upsilon _{1}^{I}|x)=\mathit{\varepsilon }(\upsilon
_{2}^{I}|x)=0.
\end{equation*}


}

\frame[plain]
{
\frametitle{The Profit Inequality Approach}
However, these expectations do not condition on $d_{i}$\\
\vspace{0.2in}
Any moment
which depends on $d_{i}$ (ie on the choice made by agent $i$ - all our
inequalities depend on this) requires properties of the disturbance
conditional on $d_{i}$. \\
\vspace{0.2in}
Since $d$ is measurable given the information set $%
\mathit{I}$, 
\begin{equation*}
\mathit{\varepsilon }(\upsilon _{1}^{I}|x,d)=0.
\end{equation*}
}

\frame[plain]
{
\frametitle{The Profit Inequality Approach}


However, since $\upsilon _{2}\in \mathit{I}$, and 
\begin{equation*}
\mathit{\varepsilon }(\pi (.)|.)=\mathit{\varepsilon }(r(.)|.)-\upsilon _{2},
\end{equation*}

if the agent chooses $d^{\ast }$ then 
\begin{equation*}
\upsilon _{2,d}-\upsilon _{2,d^{\ast }}\geq \mathit{\varepsilon }(r(.,d)|.)-%
\mathit{\varepsilon }(r(.,d^{\ast })|.)
\end{equation*}

so%
\begin{equation*}
\boxed{\mathit{\varepsilon }(\upsilon _{2,d}|x,d)\neq 0.}
\end{equation*}
More intuitively: firms are choosing $d^{\ast }$ based on the observed $%
v_{2,d^{\ast }}$, so it makes sense that there's a selection issue, ie that $%
\mathit{\varepsilon }(\upsilon _{2,d^{\ast }}|x,d^{\ast })\neq 0.$

}

\frame[plain]
{
\frametitle{The Profit Inequality Approach}
This result
implies that the statement that ``$x$ is an instrument"\ does not ``solve" the
selection problem. Formally%
\begin{equation*}
\mathit{\varepsilon }\left[ \Delta \pi (d_{i},.)|x_{i},d_{i}\right] =\mathit{%
\varepsilon }\left[ \Delta r(d_{i},.)|x_{i},d_{i}\right] -\mathit{\varepsilon }%
\left[ \upsilon _{2,i,d_{i}}^{I}-\upsilon _{2,i,d^{\prime }}^{I}|x_{i},d_{i}%
\right] .
\end{equation*}

Theory gives us $\mathit{\varepsilon }\left[ \Delta \pi (d_{i},.)|x_{i},d_{i}%
\right] \geq 0$, but this only implies 
\begin{equation*}
\mathit{\varepsilon }\left[ \Delta r(d_{i},.)|x_{i},d_{i}\right] \geq 0
\end{equation*}

if 
\begin{equation*}
\mathit{\varepsilon }\left[ \upsilon _{2,i,d_{i}}^{I}-\upsilon _{2,i,d^{\prime
}}^{I}|x_{i},d_{i}\right] \geq 0,
\end{equation*}

and \textit{this requires additional conditions on the measurement model. }We will come back to these conditions
shortly.\\ (See IC4.)

Katz's problem was to estimate the costs shoppers assign to driving to a
supermarket. \\
\vspace{0.2in}
These costs are important for the choice of supermarket
locations and, as a result, for the analysis of the impact of zoning
regulations. \\
\vspace{0.2in}
They have been difficult to analyze empirically with standard
choice models because of the complexity of the choice set facing consumers
(all possible bundles of goods at all supermarkets).

Assume that the agents' utility functions are additively separable functions
of:\begin{itemize} \item the utility from the basket of goods the agent buys, \item expenditure on that basket, and \item drive time to the supermarket. \end{itemize}
\vspace{0.1in}
Since utilities are only defined up to a monotone transformation, there is a free normalization for each individual. Katz normalizes the coefficient on expenditure for each individual to equal one. \\
\vspace{0.2in}
He allows for heterogeneity in the cost of
drive time that is known to the agents when they make their decision but
unobserved by the econometrician.  This will be one component of $\upsilon
_{2,i}$.

Possible counterfactuals:
Purchase of any bundle of goods at any store. \\

For a particular $d_{i}$ choose $d^{\prime }(d_{i})$ to be the purchase of
\begin{itemize}
\item the same basket of goods

\item at a store which is further away from the consumer's home than the
store the consumer shopped at.

This choice of $d^{\prime }(d_{i})$ allows us to difference out the impact
of the basket of goods chosen on utility. \\

I.e. if $e(d)$ and $dt(d)$ provide
the expenditure and the drive time for store choice $d$, and $(\theta
+\upsilon _{2,i})$ is agent $i$'s cost of drive time (in units of
expenditure),%

Assuming, as seems reasonable, that $(dt\left( d_{i}),dt\left( d^{\prime

dt(j)-dt(d^{\prime }(j))<0$ by choice of alternative implies that:%
\begin{equation*}
\mathit{\varepsilon }\left[ \sum_{j}\chi \left\{ d_{i}=j\right\} \left( \frac{%
e(j)-e(d^{\prime }(j))}{dt(d^{\prime }(j))-dt(j)}-(\theta +\upsilon

Let $\theta $ be the average of the cost of drive time across consumers, so $%
\sum_{i}\upsilon _{2,i}=0$ by construction, and assume IC3. Then:%
\begin{equation*}
E\left[ \frac{1}{N}\sum_{i}\left( \frac{e(d_{i})-e(d^{\prime }(d_{i}))}{%
dt(d^{\prime }(d_{i}))-dt(d_{i})}\right) \right] -\theta \leq 0,\text{ }at%
\text{ }\theta =\theta _{0}.

This result provides a lower bound to $\theta $. \\
\vspace{0.2in}
Were we to consider a second
alternative in which the bundle of goods purchased was the same as in the
actual choice but the counterfactual store required \textit{less drive time}%
, we would also get an upper bound to $\theta _{0}$. \\
\vspace{0.2in}
Katz (2007) shows that
these bounds are quite informative and provides a range for the average cost
of drive time which accords with auxiliary information, while more standard
discrete choice estimators do not.

\frametitle{Estimation from Profit Inequalities - Katz (2007)}
To obtain these inequalities we chose an alternative that allowed us to
difference out the impact of the bundle of goods chosen on utility
(differencing out our "group" effect).\\
\vspace{0.2in}
We then rearranged these differences
to form a moment which was linear in the remaining source of $\upsilon _{2}$
variance no matter $d_{i}$ (the source being differences in the costs of
travel time). }

\frame[plain]
{
\frametitle{Estimation from Profit Inequalities - Katz (2007)}
If we were interested in the impact of a particular good
purchased on utility, we would have considered baskets of goods which
differed only in that good and goods which had cross partials with that good
in the utility function, at the \textit{same} supermarket (thus differencing
out the effects of travel time and other components of utility). \\
\vspace{0.2in}A lot more
options would present themselves were we to have data on multiple shopping
trips for each household.

\begin{itemize}
\item Allows for specification errors, incorrect expectations, and
incomplete and asymmetric information.
\vspace{0.1in}
\item The econometrician does not need to specify what the agent knows about
either its competitors, or about the state of nature.
\vspace{0.1in}
\item However, it requires a (sometimes tricky) restriction on $\upsilon
_{2} $. 
\begin{itemize} \item Given that restriction, there is no need for a
distributional assumption here.
